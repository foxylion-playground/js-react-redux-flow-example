# React app with redux, redux-devtools, hot-reload and flow typings

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

## Run in dev mode

```shell
npm start
```

### Debug redux

- Use the [browser extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
  to debug state and transition. This includes a time travelling debugger.
- Save redux state with an `?debug_session=XYZ` url parameter. This will restore the
  session on page reload and across tabs.

## Run tests

```shell
npm test
```

## Build for production

```shell
npm run build
```

Output will be in `build/`.
